Lesson: Scrabble score

Make a page that takes a word and returns the Scrabble score for it. Here are the values of letters in Scrabble:

A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1

D, G                               2

B, C, M, P                         3

F, H, V, W, Y                      4

K                                  5

J, X                               8

Q, Z                               10


Objects are a bit like dictionaries - you provide a property with a name and a value, and you can retrieve the value using the name. Here's an example:

var dictionary = {"fish": "ocean animal"};
dictionary.fish
dictionary['fish'] // this is the alternate, less-used syntax for retrieving a value
dictionary.caterpillar = 'long tiny animal'; // this adds a new value to the object
dictionary.caterpillar

Refactor your Scrabble project to use objects.
